# InfoGami

A Social Network for a college made for the developers, coders, electronic freaks etc in a college.

## Motivation
College is a very exciting time in life!
We meet some of the important people in our life , we discover our interests and passion!

In a college, it's always good to be connected with the people of similar interests and to be updated on what's
happening around you.
Being a part of interest groups, or maybe starting your own, where people with similar mindset and come together
and start something exciting!

But we have Facebook , LinkedIn and various other social platforms, buttttttttttttttt :P, I always wanted the one which would be more college oriented and could be expanded with much other important functions we need.

So i created one !


## What does the platform offers

During the starting years in the college , a student has no idea about college, students around him, people of his/her interest, their social accounts, contact with seniors and alumnis etc.
So bringing all these things together makes InfoGami.

So you can :

  + Ask questions related to college, coding, software development etc. ( sorted according to the student fields).
  + Search and meet the people of your interest and skills.
  + Get the skill statistics of a person and the entire college.
  + Create Groups in college for meetups.
  + Create events, meetups or talks.
  + Create a poll to take user views and votes.
  + Work collaboratively : Find and host the projects of your interest.
  + Search for the interesting project students are working around you, and join the projects.
  + Write blog and explore others.
  + The Info : A search engine by the students and for the students, which gives always gives best results.
  + Get all the social accounts of the students at one place.
  + Explore the exam papers, pdfs and books, and add your own stuff for other students.
  + and many other things that i added ( which i don't remenber :P )

Tech Used :

  + Python
  + Django
  + HTML5, CSS3, Javascript
  + D3.js
  + and a lot more stuff :P

Will be started in NIT Kurukshetra.

## Note
